# Attributes
Palladium comes with a fair bit of new attributes which you can use:

`palladium:flight_speed` enables you to fly and determines your speed. This will also enable levitation, as the "real flight" starts when you press your sprint-key.

`palladium:flight_flexibility` determines your flexibility when flying, which means you are faster at taking curves/turns.

`palladium:levitation_speed` enables you to levitate and determines your speed for doing it. Does NOT allow you to fly fast when sprinting.

`palladium:punch_damage` is identical to Minecraft's normal attack damage attribute, except this only applies to the damage you make **with an empty hand**.

`palladium:jump_power` allows you to modify the height of your jumps.

`palladium:destroy_speed` allows you to increase the speed of destroying blocks.

`palladium:fall_resistance` can decrease your fall damage. If this attribute reaches 100, you are completely immunte to fall damage.
